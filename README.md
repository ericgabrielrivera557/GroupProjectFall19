*Our project revisits the Oregon Trail style game where users enter commands and actions that mimic reality and, in tandem, teach concepts throughout the medium of a game.* The focus
of our project is to follow a path from the inception of an innovative idea, to the creation of a widely successful company (or to its demise). The game will progress along a userâ€™s path from
the idea, to the commencement of company (with its respective co-founder[s]), to all the different challenges that will emerge -- all to resist the becoming of the leading company within
an industry! There are unequivocally many routes that can bootstrap a company to success, and our game will try to capture as many possible combinations. We hope to show how the effect of
decisions propagate among time in an entrepreneurial environment, and also teach the player some basic business principles (funding, resource allocation, R&D, market forces, etc.). Player
decisions might range from effectuations within the company culture, what R&D investments to pursue, business deals, etc. We will explore the different ways to run a company, honestly or
corruptly, and how they can lead to different outcomes. In the end, to win the game, you have to become a leading competitor within the particular industry (which will be tech-based).

To build the project, we used GameMaker Studio 2 and it is impossible to build without this proprietary engine.  For reference all of our code is screenshotted and located at ./misc/CodeScreenshotsForReference.docx, and our functionality shall be demonstrated by the youtube video below.
